# Operating-Expenses-Dashboard-and-Financial-Analysis
This project involved creating a comprehensive operating expenses dashboard using Excel, featuring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total expenses, outstanding balances, and the bank balance. The dashboard tracks monthly and yearly expenses across different categories, including personnel costs, consumables, and operating expenses. Additionally, it includes visualizations such as pie charts and bar graphs to identify top operating expenses and outstanding amounts.

My role was to:

Design and implement the dashboard layout with dynamic financial metrics.
Analyze data and track monthly/yearly trends in operating expenses.
Automate updates for efficient tracking of financial data.
Create visualizations to identify areas for cost optimization.
Provide insights into financial performance to support decision-making.
The impact of the project includes improving financial visibility, enabling better forecasting, and streamlining the expense reporting process.
